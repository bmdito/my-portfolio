I think we can kill the process in Windows as well, with :

netstat -a -o -n (running it in command prompt and then checking what is the PID of the process using our :8080 port)

then running,

taskkill /f /pid <#>
I use it on Windows 10 so can confirm it works for it, cant say about other windows versions.
